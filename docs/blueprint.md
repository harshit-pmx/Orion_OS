## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated red (#E63946) to evoke intensity, action, and passion for achieving goals. The color expresses the ambition and energy inherent to productivity and proactive time management.
- Background color: Desaturated red (#120A0A) provides a dark and unobtrusive backdrop that allows content to stand out. It is close to the original design of the orion simulation.
- Accent color: Analogous orange (#F4A261) for highlights and CTAs to complement the red and add warmth, connoting energy and optimism.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) provides a clean, modern, objective look suitable for both headlines and body text. If code will be included in the app, then this font does double duty, but if code needs to be distinct, then add Source Code Pro as the monospace font
- Use sharp, minimalist icons to represent different actions and modules.
- Maintain a clear, modular layout with distinct sections for different functionalities.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience without being distracting. Reduced motion preference respected.
